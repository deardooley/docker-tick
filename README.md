# Docker influxdata TICK Stack

This repository contains two standalone deployments of the [TICK stack](https://www.influxdata.com/).
 
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/): A single host TICK deployment using the `compose/docker-compose.yml` file. 
* [Docker Swarm](): A (multihost) deployment of the TICK stack across an existing Docker Swarm using the stack file in `swarm/stack.yml`.

See the README.md files in each environment folder for detailed explanations on how the respective deployments work.
